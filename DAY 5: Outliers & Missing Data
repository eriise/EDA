Outlier Detection
1. Quantity Outliers
All products sold in consistent batch sizes (e.g., 558 total quantity each, 30 sales).
 Quantity values are consistent — no freaky spikes.

2. Price Outliers
Bread = ₦2.50, Cake = ₦5.00, Cookies = ₦3.00
Very reasonable.
 Price points are aligned and make sense per product type.

3. Total Value Outliers
Total values are calculated as Quantity × Price.
All average totals per sale:
Bread = ₦46.50
Cake = ₦93.00
Cookies = ₦55.80
Consistent with pricing & quantity
